#This script is intended for use at ACM SER 2008 ICPC; it ensures a proper header/footer:
#
#   1)  file name
#   2)  page i of n
#   3)  time of job
#   4)  Unix "user"   ("ubuntu", possibly)
#   5)  Contents of the files /ACM/SITE /ACM/TEAM
#   6)  Hostname
#   7)  Mac address
#

#  Verify /usr/bin/enscript permissions.  chmod go+rx /usr/bin/enscript
#  Verify this script's permissions.      chomd go+rx /scripts/pcpr

#  This script uses "enscript" to print to the default printer (by default).  Verify
#  that a default printer has been configured; cf "lpstat -p -d"

# CUPS supports "PostScript" on all printers (where they have it or not).
# If the printer is a PostScript printer you need the PostScript Printer Description PPD
# file that comes with your printer.


#The header is easily spoofed if the user has access to "enscript".
#Maybe sudo can be used to make it more secure.
#
# edit /etc/sudoers with visudo
#
# ubuntu ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/bin/enscript
